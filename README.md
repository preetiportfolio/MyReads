# MyReads Project

This Project was built for Udacity NanoDegree Program as to demonstrate the understanding of React Basics , State and Props etc... This Project was started with a starter Project Task was to breakdown large application into smaller React Reusable Components and Use State and Props Appropriatly and Also Use React Router to Navigate between Pages

## TL;DR

How to get the App in Local Environment

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

Changes Done for the Project :
Break Down App.js into BookList.js, BookShelf.js, Book.js, Search.js and ShelfChanger.js Components to demonstarte the React Capabilities

Use of the App :
 There is a server API call which provides list of Books . User can Search those books using specific Search Term and then the Main View consists of Three Shelves: Currently Reading, Want To Read, and Read User can change the shelf either from the Current Page and also User can search the books from the library and add it to one of the above shelf

## Backend Server

 The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
